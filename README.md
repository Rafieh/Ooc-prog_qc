# Spring 2020 Open Online Course: Programming Quantum Computers

This repository is for student groups to collaborate on their programming assignments.

### Groups must edit only in their assigned folders!!

* Every group should have at least 1 person who knows how to use git. That person is designated the "*Git Master*" of the group, and gets write access to the repository. Since groups may change over time, the set of *Git Masters* will expand.
* For every assignment and for every group, create a fork on which your group works
* Create a pull request to "submit" your solution

If nobody in your group knows how to fork and request pulls, talk to us (Bahman or me).
